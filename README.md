# godot3-scene-notes
Scene hierarchies can get complicated, and there's no easy way of documenting that complexity - spare maybe good naming conventions. But who has time for that, right? That's why I spent a lot of time writing this add-on instead.

## Features:
* It's a glorified notepad, really.
* Node names are syntax highlighted.
* Keywords `TODO`, `HACK`, `BUG`, `FIXME` and `NOTE` are highlighted as well.
* Switching scenes in the editor switches notes automatically.
* Notes are auto-saved.
* Godot 3 ~ **a e s t h e t i c** ~ is fully supported. It uses your syntax theme, and loads some pretty icons.
